# Android Application

'Elixir' Android Application can be used to make contacts between Donors & Receivers. Registered users can request blood / organs from donors using this app. Once a request is made it automatically find matching donors with the area range provided of users. Also this app can be used to make announcements about events. (Blood Donation camps etc.)

Note - We used Google Firebase as our backend service. You can customize this app to use your own database in Firebase changing ‘MY_FIREBASE_APP’ variable in strings. To work with maps correctly, you have to create an Application in Google Developer Console and give corresponding API Keys. Or else you can use our keystore.jks file in Elixir/Keystore folder.
